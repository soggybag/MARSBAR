# MARSBAR - Student Practice to Improvement

## 2018 SBAR response

**Career path** - Need a track and general vision. This doesn't have to be definitive it needs to 
provide students with some focus. We should tell students where we think they are in job readiness. 
This could be like a grade. Two year students will feel comfortable to know they don't need to 
prepare for another year or more, while one year students will feel good to know we think they are
ready. 

Make School is not large enough to support many tracks. Instead we should focus on two or three. 

- iOS Dev
- Web Dev
- IOT Dev

**Portfolio** - Assignments might have some guide as to how these would be added to a portfolio. This 
would include: 

- Github project
- Completed project on web/app store
- Blog posts

Possibly add a portfolio class. This could be a core class for advanced students. 

**Study Time** - We need to bake in Maker/study time and have as many instructors there as possible. 
Think of this like lab time at other colleges. 

**Course Material** - We have to get more militant about course prep. Courses should be on Github 
with a clear outline and syllabus as top level README.md. 

**Student TA** - Great idea, we should work with TA's to clearly outline how they are supposed to 
help in class. TA's should get something from a class and provide something for their peers. 

## Situation

Having the ability to write quality and solve problems in code is essential to getting students jobs. 
While class time is good to get people started with a subject real learning and mastery comes from 
practice. Students have also expressed that they want more time to practice. 

Traditional classes cover material in the classroom as lectures and exercises, for the bulk of 
practice students are expected to go home and do the work there. 

The best route to maximum student success is to guarantee that students put in enough hours of 
practice to make them confident and competent programmers. 

## Background 

Make School does not give out grades. We also do not give traditional homework. Students are instead 
expected to provide the motivation to do work outside of school. This works better for some than 
for others. It's hard to assess how many hours students put in outside of school.

Without grades assessing a student's work and ability is difficult and arbitrary. 

While homework provides a way to ask students to do work and grades provide a motivator this 
carrot stick system is less than ideal.  

## Assessment 

We need to guarantee that every student puts in a requisite number of hours practicing their craft. 

This article had interesting idea: (How to land your first development job in 5 simple steps)[https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-land-your-first-development-job-in-5-simple-steps-4e9fb73314c#.6cycn9jv0]

> After you get through training for roughly 1,000 hours on code exercises and practice projects, 
> youâ€™ll need an additional 320 hours or so building more complex apps at the edge of your abilities.

The suggestion here is 1000 hours of practice followed by another 320 hours of working on more complex 
apps will put you in a good spot interview for programming jobs. 
While this is all opinion and the numbers are arbitrary the idea is compelling. It also puts the 
ideas of practice into very real and easily quantified terms. 
The numbers could argued and adjusted but, generally speaking they sound pretty solid. 

**Proposal: Students need to put in ~1320 hours over two years at Make School**

This works out to:

- 12.7 hours per week
- 1.8 Hours a day, every day for two years
- 2.5 hours per day working five days per week
- 3.6 hours every day for a year would meet the goal

You can divide this up into any number of slices. No matter how you slice it a two year goal 
is very attainable for anyone willing to show up.

Note! In the minds of most people taking a class means you learned the material. I do think this is 
true. **It's the practice that allows a person to show matery of a subject.** Make School Product 
Academy teaching methodolgy should hold this concept at it's core. With this in mind our most 
important goal is provide an environment to foster student practice. 

The numbers above don't take into account holidays and break **the real goal of this recommendation 
is to create an environment that will guarantee students spend an adequate number of hours writing 
code**. 

## Recommendation

Make School would benefit if all students were required to code 3 hours per day five days per week
for the entire two year program. 

**3 Hours of coding practice per day should be baked into the program.**

There are several approaches:  

- Plan a 3 hour block of time (we are calling this maker time at the moment).
- Classes are planned with built in blocks of coding time. At least an hour. 
- Students Should should have free periods where they can work. 
- Express to students that a key to success is their dedication and willingness to put in 3 hours per
day writing code. 

To make this work best it should be policy that students are required to come to school 10 - 6PM
everyday, like a job. 

While jobs are not exciting, adding some discipline to the program might also be good practice for 
getting students hired.
