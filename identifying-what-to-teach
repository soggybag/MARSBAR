# Identifying what to teach

## Situation

It is unclear if the skills, softwares libraries and languages we are currently teaching are 
optimal for the best student outcomes. Students must get hired to make us profitable. 

## Background

While general opinion would say the program provides students with right skills. I feel a truly 
objective assessment of the job market and software industry trends would increase the hiring 
percentage of our grads. I feel this would increase student confidence in the program. 

Our course offering for 2016 shows us teaching the following:

- Swift iOS 40.7%
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript 18.5% 
- Arduino hardware 14.8%
- Python 11.1%
- Ruby Rails 7.4%
- C# Unity 7.4%

Following is some search results that try to shed some light on the current tech job market.

This section needs more information to be truly revealing. 

1. Past successful student outcomes job skills by position.
2. List of companies who have hired out grads.

## Assessment

At a glance it would look like our program is out of sync with industry trends. In reality our
program will not target the entire industry and some of these positions will not generate positive 
student outcomes, so a direct comparison is not useful. 

That said its not clear that our course catalog ideal for the job market. Our catalog is heavily
weighted to Swift/iOS. It's not clear the current class will all become iOS developers. 

An objective look at the job market and hiring trends can only help improve our program to 
provide the best student outcomes.

## Recommendation

Identify the jobs that best fit and provide best outcomes for Make School students. Build a 
list of thse positions and companies.

Create student personas for each defined position.

Look deeply at personas to find the required skills to make a successful outcome for each. 

Define curriculum *tracks*. A track maps that student's progress through the 
program identifying each class they will take along the way.

### Start conversations with hiring companies

Question for companies that hire ms students:

- What do you look for in applicant portfolio?
- What classes subjects do you look for on resumes?
- What classes from existing schools get your interest?
- What type of experience makes more hireable applicants?
