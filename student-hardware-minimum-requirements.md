# Student Hardware Minimum Requirements

## Situation

Students entering the program with underpowered laptops are at a disadvantage.

## Background

Several students this year came into the program with older laptops. These students were at a 
disadvantage as it took them longer to setup at the beginning of class, they were slowing down 
throughout class as it longer to build projects an look up information. 

Having slow hardware plagues these students outside of class also. When working at home everything
is slower. Helping a student with a slow computer is frustrating and slow which wastes instructor
office hours. 

## Assessment

Students in the program need to have hardware that isn't holding them back.

## Recommendations

Student hardware should be assessed **before** students begin classes. Students that can afford 
new hardware will be asked to upgrade. Students who can't might be able checkout MS hardware or 
get financial aid to help upgrade.

My 2010 Macbook Pro 17 wit i7 dual core, 8gb of RAM (cannot be expanded sadly), and a 480GB SSD still romps and stomps.  If possible 16GB is useful to have lots of Chrome tabs open.  But the SSD is the key to a fast machine these days.  Cost is not too painful at aroudn $140 for a 500GB SSD.  I see some students using macbook airs and wonder how that is adequate when most only have 128GB of SSD.  I've had to recommend USB flash drives for extra space.  256GB should be the minumum space available for a dev
